NIT3213 Android Application Development Project
Overview
This project is developed as part of the NIT3213 final assignment. The application demonstrates proficiency in API integration, user interface design, and adherence to Android development best practices. It consists of three primary screens: Login, Dashboard, and Details, which interact with the vu-nit3213-api for user authentication and data retrieval.
